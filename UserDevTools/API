• For developers only! 
• To run execute "/patcher" this will run the dev tools.
• Restart once done.
• Then use boot to load it. 
• Done? You should see a list of tools. EX: ShowAdNumbers etc...
• You can exit it if you type "/exitdevscreen"
• Also, Allow root (only if jailbroken)

----

- The last step was Line 7, that step is only for jailbroken users! So, do this if you don't have ssh/root...
• Open Settings app | Tap wifi and reconnect. Then, reboot. Make sure you don't have a VPN! THEN YOUR DONE!!!

To get a key you need to verify with me. I'll give you one. I only have 12 right now, but i'll try to get more soon. You can go to:
