• Restart once done.
• Then use boot to load it. 
• Done? You should see a list of tools. EX: ShowAdNumbers etc...
• You can exit it if you type "/exitdevscreen"
• Also, Allow root (only if jailbroken)

- The last step was Line 7, that step is only for jailbroken users! So, do this if you don't have ssh/root...
• Open Settings app | Tap wifi and reconnect. Then, reboot. Make sure you don't have a VPN! THEN YOUR DONE!!!
